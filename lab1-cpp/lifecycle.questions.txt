1. It looks like the default constructor is called before main(). Is it because C++ is programmed to always call the default constructor first?

2. I noticed there is a '&' after some argumemts (ex. MyObject&). The reading states that this refers to pass by reference. Does this mean method with MyObject& parameter changes that object in that dedicated memory space while one with just MyObject copy paste values of that object and change just those value? 

3. Following question 2, the constructor MyObject(const MyObject& rhs) has const. What does this const do?

4. In char *n= "--default--", what does * do to n?
